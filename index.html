            <h2>How Personal Injury Lawyers Get Paid & Client Compensation Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Personal injury lawyers typically work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, meaning they only get paid if they win the case. Their fee is a percentage of the final settlement or court award, usually ranging between <strong>25% and 40%</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Breakdown of Payment Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lawyer's Fee:</strong> Typically, <strong>33.3% (or 1/3)</strong> of the total compensation is taken by the lawyer. However, this can vary:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>25%</strong> if settled early (before filing a lawsuit).</li>
                    <li><strong>33.3%</strong> if settled after filing but before trial.</li>
                    <li><strong>40%</strong> if the case goes to trial.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Client's Share:</strong> The client receives the remaining amount (<strong>60% to 75%</strong>) after the lawyer’s fee is deducted.</li>
                <li>The client <strong>may also need to cover case expenses</strong> (court fees, expert witnesses, etc.), which are sometimes deducted separately.</li>
